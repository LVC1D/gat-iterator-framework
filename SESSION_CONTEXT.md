## Week 4, Day 1 - Completed

**Date:** October 28, 2025  
**Total time:** ~3 hours  
**Confidence:** 4-5/5 on GATs

**What went well:**
- Self-corrected logic bugs through testing
- Replication test passed smoothly
- Git workflow becoming natural

**Key learning:**
- GATs solve the fixed-lifetime problem for lending iterators
- Aliasing XOR mutability prevents multiple overlapping borrows
- Tarpaulin can have quirks with generic code coverage

**For Day 2:**
- Continue Git workflow habits
- Ready for HRTBs application
- Feeling solid on advanced types
